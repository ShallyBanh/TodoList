# TodoList
A simple todo list web app using react.js and shopify's polaris library https://polaris.shopify.com/


## Inspiration

Kind of wanted to learn react and i needed to find a better todo list app to keep myself organized so i figure why not kill two birds with one stone and build one myself

## Current Progress

Currently it looks like this:

Now, using polaris it looks like this:

The core functionality (adding and completing events is done). There's so UI tweaks left to be done and also added the ability to keep track of history.

## ToDo
- <s> Adding and Completing events</s>
- <s>Switch to use Polaris library</s>
- Store History of Completed Events
- UI fixes
